### ⚙️ How It Works

#### (1) Email Scanning
The bot continuously monitors inboxes to identify emails with resume attachments using **smart subject-based filters**.

#### (3) Candidate Data Extraction
The system automatically extracts **candidate details** such as name and email for personalization.

#### (4) Automated Communication
- **Suitable/Borderline candidates:** Automatically forwarded to interviewers.  
- **Not Suitable candidates:** Ignored.  

This ensures **consistency, transparency,** and improved **candidate engagement**.

#### 🧠 Centralized Control
The entire automation flow is orchestrated via **UiPath Orchestrator**, enabling smooth **scheduling, monitoring, and execution** of the process.
